# Kaggle-Titanic

I will use different decision tree based models for the Titanic competition on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/overview

Also, I will try to do hyperparameter tuning by Grid Search, Random Search and Bayesian method.

If there is an overfitting issue, I will add regularization.

For Random Forest, the accuracy on test is  0.8547 on the submission is 0.7703.
